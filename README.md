# Overview

A course which exposes students to the practical applications of business process automation (BPA) in various forms observed in industry.
Traditional BPA entails developing a sequence of logical operations for integrating relevant applications in the digital ecosystem to execute a routine process that provides business value.
The business value can take the form of improved decision-making, improved accuracy, increased employee efficiency, or risk/injury reduction.
Students will learn what BPA is, why it is strategically important, and how organizations deploy traditional BPA technologies to streamline operations.


## Learning objectives:

*Successful students will be able to:*

  1. Recognize repeated tasks which can be automated by a computer.
  2. Write a descriptive specification of automation for non-technical users.
  3. Model process automation mathematically.
  4. Make informed judgements of acceptable input specificity
  5. Perform root-cause analysis of unexpected process behavior.
  6. Perform network analysis via a web browser to automate networked communication.
  7. Combine multiple automations together into a workflow.


*Course Outcomes:*

  1. Students will demonstrate a theoretical understanding of process automation via homework and exams.
  2. Students will demonstrate a practical understanding by creating standardized and individualized process automations which can be shown to employers.


# Course Description


The act of transforming a task

The learning goals for the course are *two-fold;* understanding product development and learning collaborative software development techniques.

Modern software product development tends to utilize *Agile* methodology to varying degrees. Consequently, the course is structured in weekly "sprints." Each week teams plan what they will accomplish for the next week. After a week of work teams report on their progress, reassess feasibility of future work based on the progress of last week, and revise a new plan for the following week of work. The theory of this methodology is to provide rapid feedback and iteration for software development, so that minimal time is spend on "dead-end" feature which will not enhance the product.

Collaborative software develompment is a crucial skill for any computer science major, regardless of their intended plans after graduation. This course will require students to use `git`, facilitated by GitHub, to add, modify, and merge code while developing their product. Additionally, and equally important, is the ability to communicate clearly and promptly with team mates to facilitate and coordinate tasks. Teams are expected to develop their own, preferred communication channels, be that email, IRC, Slack, Discord, BlackBoard, or another agreed upon medium.

Lastly, team performance is an important consideration. Prior to starting on their project, each team will author a "social contract" for their team which outliens the expectations of team members and consequences for failing to meet the expectations. This "social contract" document often includes, stating the preferred medium of communication, setting regular meeting times for collaborative work, expected number of hours each team member will devote to working on the course project each week, how to communicate if a team member cannot meet their obligations for a given week, what to do if a team member consistently doesn't meet their weekly obligations.


# Course Description

The course can be broken up into two phases:

  1.  **Theory** *(4 weeks):*
      In this phase students will learn the theoretical foundations for process automation, including data transformer models, compositional functional programming, infinite processes, and finite state automata.
 
  2. **Practice** *(12 weeks)*
     In this phase students will survey different applications of the theoretical tools in practical application.
     The topics of this phase can be subdivided into two additional categories:
       1. Localized Automation:
         - Data transformation
         - Data input (CLI & GUI)
         - Daemonization (always independently running)
         - Logging/Debugging
         - Documenting process automation
         - Designing Workflows (combine automations)
   
       2. Networked Automation:
         - Subscription processing (RSS feeds, etc.)
         - Web APIs (REST)
         - Web scraping (get information)
         - Web submissions (send information)
         - Web debugging/fuzzing/probing
         - Sniping (timed submission)
         - Bots (interactive automation)

After the first phase of the course, each student will be required to submit a practicum before the end of the semester.
The practicum will cosist of a small process automation project of the student's choosing (with instructor approval).
The practicum should demonstrate the application of the process automation topics to a task the student is familiar with.

| Practicum Presentation  |   15%          |
| Practicum Project       |   15%          |


## Homeworks

Homework will consist of several written assignments designed to test the student's knowledge of theoretical topics in process automation.


## Midterm

The midterm will test the studen't theoretical knowledge of process automation by proposing several scenarios and ask the student to analyze them using different theoretical techniques.


## Programs

Students will be assigned to write program which demonstrate thier ability to automate a task. The task will consist of a well specified function to be automated and will guide the student as to which technolgies and techniques should be utilized to acheive the required automation.


## Practicum

The practicum consists of *three* components

1.  The first component is a proposal authored by the student describing a task of thier choosing to be automated.
    The proposal should include a detailed specification of the automation plan in addition to a outline describing the technical tools and methodologies to be used.
    After submitting the proposal the instructor will review and possibly suggest revisions to the pracitcum proposal.
    Once any instructor comments on the proposal have been addressed, the instructor will approve the practicum for the student.

    ***Note:*** *While the due date is 03/31, the practicum proposal may be submitted for review earlier!*

    Early submission of the practicum proposal is recomended to provide ample time for refinement before starting the precticum.
    Students who complete thier practicum early in the semester will allot themselves extra free time for finals in other courses at the end of the semester.


2.  After receiving approval for the practicum proposal, the student will be assigned a presentation slot during one of the Monday class times starting on 03/23.
    The student may then also begin work on automating thier specified task.
    During the presentation time slot, the student will provide a 10 minute presentation describing thier task to be automated, how they have autimated the task, and provide a breif technical demonstration.
    The student should submit thier presentation slides via email *before* thier presentation.

3.  Subsequently, after presenting thier practicum, the student will submit the code for thier task automation.
    The submission must take the form of a GitHub repository containing all necissary code and artifacts/data to perform the process automation.
    The repository must contain a `README.md` describing the task to be automated and how to install/setup the code in repository to peform the automation task.
    it is recommended to reuse applicable content from the practicum proposal and presentation slides in the `README.md` description.


# Grading

| Grade | Score Earned |
|:-----:|-------------:|
|   A   |   `>=` 90%   |
|   B   |   `>=` 80%   |
|   C   |   `>=` 70%   |
|   D   |   `>=` 60%   |
|   F   |   `< ` 60%   |

The letter grade earned by a student will be *at least* what is described in the table above. A plus or minus to a letter grade may be determined by the relative performance of the student to their peers in the course, their participation in helping peers in other teams with technical problems, and the team assessment at the end of the semester.

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ([20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99][ferpa-law]) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing.
After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions ([34 CFR § 99.31][ferpa-law-consent]):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.
